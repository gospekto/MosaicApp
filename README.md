# MosaicApp
A desktop application written in C# and Assembly that transforms uploaded images into stunning mosaics. The program allows users to upload an image, process it into a mosaic by dividing it into smaller tiles, and customize the output using advanced settings. Key features include:  
- Image Upload: Select any image to transform.  
- Processing Library: Choose between C# or Assembly for image processing.  
- Customization Options: Adjust thread count for parallel processing and tile size for mosaic granularity.  
- Output: Generate and download the mosaic, ideal for creating pixelated or retro-style art.

The user-friendly interface, built with Windows Forms, includes options to select images, configure settings, and preview both the original and mosaicked results side by side. This project showcases a blend of high-level C# programming for the UI and low-level Assembly for efficient image manipulation, making it a great example of hybrid programming for image processing enthusiasts.
